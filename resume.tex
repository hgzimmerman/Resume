\textbf{Software Engineer (Co-Op)} \textit{Ocient} \hfill Aug 2016 - Jan 2017 \textbar{} May 2017 - Aug 2017\\

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{2em}% 1em left, 2em right
{\textbf{DB Configuration Client}} {\sl NodeJS, Angular 2+, TypeScript, Protobuf, Pivotal Tracker} \\
    A distributed database product being developed required a tool so that nodes could be configured and monitored.
\vspace*{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5mm] \itemsep -1mm
	\item Worked on a 2 person team to develop the backend and frontend of a webapp
	\item Created components for manipulating nodes, clusters, and configuring machine learning algorithms to run across the clusters
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Performance Monitoring Tool}} {\sl C++, Protobuf, NCurses} \\
    The database engine development team didn't have insight into where performance bottlenecks were. 
    They had instrumented performance counters in the engine, but had no way to visualize the data.
\vspace*{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5mm] \itemsep -1mm
	\item Implemented a TUI utility to visualize performance counter data as benchmarks were run on the database, or emit CSV for further analysis
	\item Backend team was able to use the utility to assess the effects of their changes on the performance of the system
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}

\textbf{Software Engineer (Co-Op)} \textit{MedPoint Digital} \hfill Jan 2018 - May 2018\\

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{2em}% 1em left, 2em right
{\textbf{JWT Security and Performance Audit}} {\sl C\#, .NET, JWT, Javascript} \\
A set of APIs initially built without any security measures were being retrofitted with a JWT-based scheme to provide authorization for a distributed monolith.
\vspace*{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5mm] \itemsep -1mm
	\item Discovered that the initial solution was not secure and far less performant than possible
	\item Wrote documents detailing how to exploit the vulnerability, and how to secure against the attack%, and how to remove reliance on external caches for the system.
    \item Proposed authorization solution would utilize database more than 13 times less frequently
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Uptime Monitoring Tool}} {\sl C\#, .NET Core, Angular 2+, Typescript} \\
Various services for a product had poor reliability and poor visibility for determining when they were unavailable, or if they had been down in the recent past.
\vspace*{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4.5mm] \itemsep -1mm 
	\item Wrote an internal tool that would record the recent uptime for the company\textquotesingle{}s services and display them in a webapp
    \item Based on team needs, engineered a Webapp that displays history for 3 days for service availability for services running on dev, test, and production environments
