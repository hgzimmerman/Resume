\textbf{Ocient} \hfill Chicago, IL\\
\textit{Software Engineer (Co-Op)} \hfill Aug 2016 - Jan 2017 \textbar{} May 2017 - Aug 2017\\
\vspace*{1mm}
{\textbf{DB Configuration Client}} {\sl NodeJS, Angular 2+, TypeScript, Protobuf} \\
    A distributed database product being developed required a tool so that nodes could be configured and monitored.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Worked on a 2 person team to develop the backend and frontend of a webapp. 
	\item Created components for manipulating nodes, clusters, and configuring machine learning algorithms to run across the clusters.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Performance Monitoring Tool}} {\sl C++, Protobuf, NCurses} \\
    The database engine development team didn't have insight into where performance bottlenecks were and had instrumented performance counters in the engine, but had no way to visualize the data.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Implemented a TUI utility using C++ and NCurses to visualize performance counter data, or emit CSV for further analysis.
	\item Backend team was able to use the utility to assess the effects of their changes on the performance of the system.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}



\textbf{MedPoint Digital} \hfill Evanston, IL\\
\textit{Software Engineer (Co-Op)} \hfill Jan 2018 - May 2018\\
{\textbf{JWT Security and Performance Audit}} {\sl C\#, .NET, JWT, Javascript} \\
An set of APIs initially built without any security measures was being retrofitted with a JWT-based scheme to provide authorization for a distributed monolith.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Discovered that the proposed solution was defective and far less performant than possible.
	\item Wrote documents detailing how to exploit the vulnerability, how to secure against the attacks, and how to remove reliance on external caches for the system.
    \item Proposed solution would reduce database utilization by the authorization system by more than 13 times the initially suggested system.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}

{\textbf{Uptime Monitoring Tool}} {\sl C\#, .NET Core, Angular 2+, Typescript} \\
Various services for a product had poor reliability and poor visibility for determining when they were unavailable, or if they had been down in the recent past.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Wrote an internal tool that would record the recent uptime for the company\textquotesingle{}s services and display them in a webapp.\\
    \item Webapp would display history for three days for service availability for services running on dev, test, and production environments.
\end{itemize}
